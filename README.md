# prog-budget

This application is a Proggressive web application that saves user input and uploads it even if functioning offline.
We utilize node.js, express, and mongodb for this project.
its a simple budget tracker that on page load will have previous data saved. you can clear it by reseting your database in dev tools.
once on you can head to network in dev tools, then set your connection to offline. once you do that input an expense or earning.
it will immediatly pop up on the screen but wont actually save to your database. once you snap it back online it will save correctly.
below is a gif demonstrating its functionality.
